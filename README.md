Hi!  I and the GitHub Training Team have done some reorganization of repos, but they all still exist and we'd be delighted to point you to them. The full (and greatly expanded) set of sample repos now lives at https://github.com/githubschool. You can also check out some our even deeper (and fully open source) Git learning resources at https://github.com/github/training-kit.
